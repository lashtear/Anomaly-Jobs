On MUSH 3 installations, attribute limits have been cut to 4k due to possible
corruption issues of attributes over 4096 bytes in size (a GDBM database
issue, not an issue with Anomaly Jobs). Some debate exists on this point, but
rather to be safe than sorry, I've installed a buffer limit for 4k on MUSH 3
and 8k on MUX. If you use a MUSH 3 install, we do not recommend that you change
the buffer limit (on the Database object as BUFFER), but it can be done if you
are sure you won't have creeping data death. Modify at your own risk.
