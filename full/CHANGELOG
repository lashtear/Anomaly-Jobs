CHANGELOG for full install of Anomaly Jobs


Full Install. 

Version 5.1
- Removed '@trigger %vb/TRIG_APPROVE=%0,%#,%1,[get(%q0/TITLE)]' from the +job/approve command. This is deprecated code left over from the Jobs 4 days. TRIG_ADD handles the TRIG_APR hook now.
- Edited the BBoard configuration, making sure that POST_DELETE was set on the Job Parent Object <JPO> and pointing to the Staff Job Tracker bulletin board.
- Fixed bracket matching and missed get() in +myjob/add command attribute.
- Changed +myjob view command to use @dolist instead of iter(). This stop the command from hitting buffer limits.
- Made sure that flag setting on PUB occurred befor teleportation of the PUB object into storage.
- Updated the Version and Credits information.
- Corrected @wait on final restart so it runs after final @pemit.
- Fixed +job/sumset so that checks are in the correct order.
- Udpated +job/set in jhelp.txt &commands2
- Updated +myjob/view with missing @pemit.
- More fixes and updates to +job/sumset. 
- Pulled out the tagged_for check on +myjob/add for two reason. First, the intent is unclear consider the code is buggy. Two, removing it makes sure the job is only locked by +job/lock, making +myjob/add work like +job/add.
- Added Maintainer line to +job/credits.

Version 5.2
- Modified destruction behavior for Rhost compatibility and consistency across all code-bases; Jobs will now remain GOING for one minute after closure in which they may be saved by +job/trans.
- Various other changes for Rhost compatibility.
