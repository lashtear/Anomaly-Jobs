- Removed '@trigger %vb/TRIG_APPROVE=%0,%#,%1,[get(%q0/TITLE)]' from the +job/approve command. This is deprecated code left over from the Jobs 4 days. TRIG_ADD handles the TRIG_APR hook now.
- Edited the BBoard configuration, making sure that POST_DELETE was set on the Job Parent Object <JPO> and pointing to the Staff Job Tracker bulletin board.
- Fixed bracket matching and missed get() in +myjob/add command attribute.

- Fixed +job/sumset so that checks are in the correct order.

- Updated +myjob/view with missing @pemit.
- More fixes and updates to +job/sumset. 
- Pulled out the tagged_for check on +myjob/add for two reasons. First, the intent is unclear considering the code is buggy. Two, removing it makes sure the job is only locked by +job/lock, making +myjob/add work like +job/add.
