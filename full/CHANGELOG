CHANGELOG for full install of Anomaly Jobs


Full Install. 

Version 5.1
- Removed '@@trigger %vb/TRIG_APPROVE=%0,%#,%1,[get(%q0/TITLE)]' from the +job/approve command. This is deprecated code left over from the Jobs 4 days. TRIG_ADD handles the TRIG_APR hook now.
- Edited the BBoard configuration, making sure that POST_DELETE was set on the Job Parent Object <JPO> and pointing to the Staff Job Tracker bulletin board.
