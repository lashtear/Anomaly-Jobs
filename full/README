1. Installing Anomaly Jobs 6.1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installing Jobs 6.1 is fairly straight forward. You quote the install file to
your game and the install is automated. However, before you install it read
the README and the README.<dist> file for your server for any notes, and 
read the install file notes for behavioral changes you might wish to make.

  IMPORTANT!
  
  * You should install this with a Wizard character, preferably in an
    account that is not regularly logged into, as the code creates and
    destroys objects dynamically. This can get spammy.
    
  * Do not rename your jobs objects. Patch and plugin scripts depend on 
    these names in order to function.
    
  * You must install using a timed delay. Most clients have an upload-
    with-delay option. A delay of at least one second is recommended.
    
  * Be patient. The install script will tell you when it is finished.
    Don't try to do anything until install is complete.

This code REQUIRES Myrddin's BBS to be installed, as it uses the BBS to post
completed/approved/denied jobs to. So long as your BBS is unmodified it should
work without problems. There is no need to configure the BBS or create any
bboards, as it will work its magic automatically. It will automatically set up
two BBS boards to use with the system - a public read-only BBS for game-wide
progress tracking, and a private, staff-only board for privately tracking
player requests and other issues.

It also requires hardcoded @mail at this time. The jobs system owner is
excluded from mailings in the default setup.

This script requires no modification so long as used on the servers listed
above and you want the behavior to be for staff-only.

If upgrading from a 5.0 install and you have the HOOK_APPROVE, HOOK_DENY, 
HOOK_COMPLETE, or HOOK_DELETE attributes set on your Job Parent Object or any
buckets, move these hooks to HOOK_APR, HOOK_DNY, HOOK_COM, and HOOK_DEL,
respectively. The previous versions were unintentionally redundant in 5.x and
will no longer be triggered in Jobs 6. The script will notify you if it finds
these outdated hooks.

In addition to quoting the script, you will need to install the help file on
your server.  Two similar files are provided: jhelp.txt is designed to be
evaluated (e.g., using "helpfile" in MUX or the textentries() and textfile()
functions in PennMUSH) while jhelp_ansi.txt is already preprocessed with ANSI
sequences, suitable for "helpfile" in PennMUSH or "raw_helpfile" in MUX.

2. Buckets
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jobs are stored in buckets, which is a method of organization that keeps jobs
sorted in their proper locations. Jobs are parented to its bucket, allowing 
the bucket settings to cascade down to job level.

The system has several buckets already installed, but you may wish to add more.
You can add buckets with the +bucket/add command (see the +help files).

ADMIN   General Administration issues.
APPS    Player Applications
BUILD   Building issues and typos (Required bucket).
CGEN    Character Generation issues.
CODE    For coding issues and bug reports (Required bucket).
FEEP    A hidden bucket for creeping features aka feeping creatures.
FORUM   A discussion forum.
PITCH   Plot and game idea pitches (Required bucket).
PUB     Public jobs (Jobs in bucket appear in everyone's +myjobs list).
QUERY   Player queries (Required bucket).
REQ     Player requests (Required bucket).
RP      Hidden bucket for storing future plots.
TECH    Technology issues, such as weapon object distribution, etc.
THEME   Game thematic issues.
TPS     Currently running plots.

A bucket name is 1-5 letters long. WoD games might want to add VAMP, GAROU,
MAGE, FAE, etc.

The BUILD, CODE, PITCH, QUERY, and REQ buckets are associated with commands
and should not be deleted; APPS is associated with TRIG_APPLY and should not
be deleted if you use that trigger.  Other buckets may be removed if desired.



3. Getting Help
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The primary location to get help and report bugs for Jobs 6 is the google 
code site at http://code.google.com/p/anomalyjobs/ 



4. Integrating Applications with Jobs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As an optional feature, you can post character application information to the
+jobs board, and have your approval queue attached to the board. However,
you must provide your own @trigger for TRIG_APPLY on the database object, run
when a new player finished character generation. This trigger puts a character
application into the Jobs system. To add this functionality to your game, you
must add the following code to your 'please approve me' command:

  @trigger <Job Database>/TRIG_APPLY=<player DB# to be approved>

To change the information presented to player upon application submission,
see the APPS bucket setup.  You can use the HOOK_APR on the APPS bucket to
take action upon application approval.



5. +job/log - Log File
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The LOGFILE attribute is the base name of the log file. On MUX and RhostMUSH,
you can change the log file for each bucket (or the default on the Job
Parent Object) with the LOGFILE attribute.  

The two default <logfiles> are 'reqlog' (for all player +requests) and 
'joblog' (for all other buckets).  Logs are directed to:

MUX:       /game/logs/M-<logfile>.log (Note 1)
RhostMUSH: /game/<logfile>_manual.log (Note 2)
TinyMUSH:  /game/netmush.log
PennMUSH:  /game/log/command.log

Note 1: This file must exist, or logging will fail.  To create an empty file,
navigate to the /game/logs directory on the server and "touch M-joblog.log".

Note 2: RhostMUSH permits subdirectories defined as part of the logfilename.



6. Automatic Logging
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add the following to your system if you wish automatic logging:

&HOOK_APR Job Parent Object <JPO>=@trigger [v(VA)]/TRIG_LOG=%0,[v(VA)]
&HOOK_DEL Job Parent Object <JPO>=@trigger [v(VA)]/TRIG_LOG=%0,[v(VA)]
&HOOK_DNY Job Parent Object <JPO>=@trigger [v(VA)]/TRIG_LOG=%0,[v(VA)]
&HOOK_COM Job Parent Object <JPO>=@trigger [v(VA)]/TRIG_LOG=%0,[v(VA)]



7. Max Jobs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This attribute controls how many jobs are allowed in the system
before it halts new job creation. Try to keep this number
reasonable based on your game's size. A small game can stick with
200. Larger games may have to boost the number. However, keep in
mind that boosting it also decreases security, as twinks can
potentially spam the system through spurious job creation.

&MAX_JOBS Job Database <JD>=200



8. Automatic Assignment
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you would like jobs to automatically assign a job to the
person who invoked +job/create, then set the following:

&HOOK_CRE Job Parent Object <JPO>=&ASSIGNED_TO %0=%1

For automatic assignment of jobs created other than with +job/create, use:

&HOOK_OTH <JPO or bucket>=&ASSIGNED_TO %0=<player or jgroup dbref>



9. Access Configuration
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following attributes are located on the Jobs Database object and may be
modified to configure access to the system.

HAS_ACCESS      : Return 1 if player can access the +jobs code.
ADD_ACCESS      : Return 1 if player can /add to jobs.
APPROVE_ACCESS  : Return 1 if player can /approve jobs.
COMPLETE_ACCESS : Return 1 if player can /complete jobs.
CREATE_ACCESS   : Return 1 if player can /create jobs.
DENY_ACCESS     : Return 1 if player can /deny jobs.
EDIT_ACCESS     : Return 1 if player can edit a job.
GIVE_ACCESS     : Return 1 if player can +bucket/access.
LOG_ACCESS      : Return 1 if player can /log a job.
MAIL_ACCESS     : Return 1 if player can /mail regarding a job.
STATS_ACCESS    : Return 1 if player can get reports.
CONFIG_ACCESS   : Return 1 if player can use /sumset.


10. Staff Checks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following ufuncs on the Jobs Database are used to check if a player is
staff. They are tailored to each codebase.

FN_WIZONLY      : Return 1 if the player is a wizard or equivalent.
FN_STAFFALL     : Return 1 if the player is a wizard or royalty, or equivalent.
