1. Installing the Anomaly Jobs 5.1 Patch

Installing the Anomaly Jobs 5.1 patch is fairly straight forward. You quote 
the patch install file to your game and the install is automated. 

Manual changes required:
Jobs 5.0 did not setup the default delete board. In most cases this is not
required, but in some cases why doing custom pletter_del setups, this is 
needed. Do '&POST_DELETE Job Parent Object <JPO>=<#>' where the # is the 
Staff Job Tracker board or the default board you want to use.
