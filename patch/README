1. Installing the Anomaly Jobs 5.2 Patch

Installing the Anomaly Jobs 5.2 patch is fairly straight forward. You quote 
the patch install file to your game and the install is automated. 

	IMPORTANT!
	
	* You should install this with a Wizard character, preferably with
	  the same account you installed Jobs with.
	  
	* Do not rename your jobs objects. Patch scripts depend on these names
	  in order to function. If you've renamed your Jobs objects, do not
	  run this script. And furthermore: shame on you.
	  
	* You should not be holding anything (exits, objects) or be inside a
	  room with a lot of exits. Names might conflict.
	  
	* You must install using a timed delay. Most clients have an upload-
	  with-delay option. A delay of at least one second is recommended.
	  
	* Be patient. The install script will tell you when it is finished.
	  Don't try to do anything until install is complete.
