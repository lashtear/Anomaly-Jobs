CHANGELOG for patch install of Anomaly Jobs

Verion 5.1
- Emptied out the install file to a clean slate for upcoming 5.1 changes.
- Renamed file to jobs_5.1-patch.txt

- Added updated +myjob/add command. Fixes bracket matching and missing get().
- Added updated +myjob command. Fixes buffer limitation.
