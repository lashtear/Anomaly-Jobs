
& pitch
  +pitch <title>=<description>
  
  This command tosses an idea to staff. The idea can be story related or just
  an idea on how to make the game better. PITCH jobs are different from those
  created with +request. They are not issued due dates. Staff is under no
  obligation to even answer them. By procedure, they are either discarded
  with no fanfare, tucked away for future implementation or they are run with
  either in modified or unmodified form.
  
  For story pitches, it puts a story idea into the RP jobs bucket. Now, this 
  is not a request for a TP, this is a method of giving story ideas, or theme 
  ideas, to the staff for consideration. If you want to request a scene, use 
  +request.

& request
  
  +request <title>=<description>
  
  This command requests <title> and <description> from staff. The request is 
  added to the jobs list and will be tended to as soon as possible. Please do 
  not bug staff - it will be handled shortly. There is a standard three day
  turnaround time on +requests.
    
& bug
  
  +bug <title>=<description>
  
  This command is used for bug reporting. In <title> put the command that is 
  bugged, or something else appropriate. Please be as descriptive as possible
  in the <description> field. What were the results you were expecting? What 
  happened in its place? By giving lots of detail here, it saves us the time of 
  tracking you down to drag the information out of you. Thanks.
  
& typo
  
  +typo <typo description>
  
  This command reports a typo. Please be specific about where the typo is, what
  the typo is, and what you think it should be changed to.
  
& myjobs

  +myjobs
  +myjob <#>
  +myjob/add <#>=<comment>
  
  This suite of commands allows the submitter to view and modify jobs that they have
  submitted to the system. When viewing a job that you own, you can only see the
  comments that you have added, not comments added by others.

& jobs-list
  These commands help you sort through various +jobs.
  
  +jobs
  +jobs/all
  +jobs/<bucket>
  +jobs/mine
  +jobs/pri
  +jobs/search <pattern>
  +jobs/new
  
  The first command displays a list of all +jobs for buckets that you have
  access to, not including any jobs in hidden buckets. The second command
  displays a list of all jobs in all buckets that you have access to, including
  hidden buckets. The third command gets a list of all jobs in <bucket>,
  provided that you have access to <bucket>. Using the /mine switch, you can
  get a list of all jobs assigned to you. Using the /pri switch, you can get a
  list of jobs by priority. You can /search through jobs for <pattern> and get
  a list of all jobs containing it. Using /new you can list all jobs that have
  new activity.
  
  Please see: jobs-list2
  
& jobs-list2
  +jobs/sort
  +jobs/date
  +jobs/stats
  +jobs/overdue
  +jobs/who <player>

  Using the /sort switch, you can get a list of jobs sorted by bucket. The list
  isn't very pretty, however. Using the /date switch, you can get a list of
  jobs sorted by when the job was last modified, with recent modifications
  at the bottom of the list. Using the /stats switch, you can get a list of
  basic statistics on the jobs system. With the /overdue switch, you can list
  all jobs that are in overdue status. The /who switch allows you to get a
  list of jobs that have been assigned to <player>. 
  
& jobs-create
  Jobs can be created in a variety of ways. Players can use +pitch to put up
  a PITCH job, +request to put up a REQ job, +bug to put up a CODE job, and
  +typo to put up a BUILD job.
  
  +job/create <bucket>/<title>=<text of job>
  
  This command allows those with access to the system to create a new job. This
  job is placed into <bucket>, provided the enactor has access to that bucket.
  Jobs created with the suite of player commands are assigned priorities,
  buckets, and due dates automatically. The /create command creates a jobs with
  none of this information - it is a clean slate.

  +job/query <player list>/<title>=<query>
  
  This command opens a job in the QUERY bucket, and mails <player list> with
  the query. Players have 7 days to respond to queries.
  
& jobs-manage
  
  +job <#>
  +job/add <#>=<comments>
  +job/trans <#>=<bucket>
  +job/esc <#>=<green|yellow|red>
  +job/assign <#>=<player>
  +job/merge <source>=<destination>
  
  The first command allows you to view an individual job. You can only see
  added comments with this command. The second command adds <comments> to job
  <#>. The third command transfers job <#> to <bucket>. The next command alters
  job <#>'s escalation code to <green> or <yellow> or <red>. The next command
  assigns job <#> to <player>. The next command merges two jobs together.
  Job <source> is copied into Job <destination>.
  
  Please see: jobs-manage2
& jobs-manage2
  +job/mail <#>=<message>
  
  The /mail switch sends the player who opened job <#> a <message> via @mail
  and gives instructions to the player on how to respond to the mail.
  
  +job/set <#>=<0-6>
  +job/due <#>=<<date>|none>
  +job/act <#>
  +job/name <#>=<name>
  
  The first command changes job <#>'s status from <0> to <6>. The second 
  command allows you to set a due date for job <#>. The <date> string can be
  in one of two formats: 'Jan 13 10:00:00 2003' or '01/13/03'. Using /act 
  will allow you to view all job actions performed on a job - escalations, 
  sets, merges, all information will be displayed, with when the action was 
  performed and by whom. Using /name allows you to change the <name> of 
  Job <#>.
  
  The /set value codes are: 0=ON HOLD, 1=NEW, 2=UNDERWAY, 3=1/4 COMPLETE, 
  4=1/2 COMPLETE, 5=3/4 COMPLETE, 6=COMPLETE.
  
  Please see: jobs-manage3
& jobs-manage3

  +job/lock <#>
  +job/unlock <#>
  
  When a job is locked, it cannot be modified in any way until unlocked.
  
  +job/edit <#>/<Entry #>=<Old>/<New>
  
  This command edits <Entry #> on Job <#>, replacing <Old> with <New>.  

  +jobs/compress
  
  This is a wizard-only command. When job ID numbers become too large (say,
  in the thousands), it is prudent to compress your job list to make the
  numbers more manageable. When you compress the jobs, it renumbers all
  open jobs, one through X, and resets the next available job number.
    
& jobs-complete
  
  +job/complete <#>=<comment>
  +job/approve <#>=<comment>
  +job/deny <#>=<comment>
  +job/delete <#>
  
  The first command allows you to complete job <#>. When /complete is used,
  the first comment of the job and your <comment> is posted on the public job
  bboard. No intermittent comments are posted to keep the buffer limit small
  (so that the BBS can handle it). It then deletes the job. /approve works in
  the same fashion, except the player who opened the job is sent an @mail, and
  a copy is posted to the staff-only job tracker. /deny works in the same 
  fashion as /approve, only informs the job-opener that their request or job 
  is denied.
  
  The /delete is only usable by a WIZARD character. The /complete, /approve 
  and /deny commands can all be individually locked.
  
& jobs-config

  Anomaly Jobs has a tiered access structure. By changing who has access to
  various commands, you can selectively allow players like builders into the
  system so they can work. The access locks are on the Job Database <JD>
  object. Bucket access locks are stored there too.
  
  HAS_ACCESS: Returns 1 if a player can access the +jobs system.
     COMPLETE_ACCESS: Returns 1 if a player can /complete jobs.
     APPROVE_ACCESS:  Returns 1 if a player can /approve jobs.
     DENY_ACCESS:     Returns 1 if a player can /deny jobs.
     CREATE_ACCESS:   Returns 1 if a player can use the /create command.
     ADD_ACCESS:      Returns 1 if a player can use the /add command.
     GIVE_ACCESS:     Returns 1 if a player can use +bucket/access.
     EDIT_ACCCESS:    Returns 1 if a player can use the /edit command.
     STATS_ACCESS:    Returns 1 if a player can pull stats on the system.
     MAIL_ACCESS:     Returns 1 if a player can /query and /mail.
     ACCESS_<BUCKET>: Returns 1 if a player can access <BUCKET>.
     PUBLIC_<BUCKET>: If set, the bucket can be seen with +myjobs.
  
  A player must pass HAS_ACCESS before the other locks are applied.
  
& jobs-credits
  
  +jobs/credits
  
  This command will list the current version, release date, and license
  information for Anomaly Jobs.
  
& buckets
  +buckets
  +bucket/info <bucket>
  +bucket/monitor <bucket>
  
  The first command displays a list of buckets that you have access to, and
  what their monitor status is. Using the /info switch, you can get information
  on a particular <bucket>, such as access locks, hidden status, and connected
  players who have access to it. By invoking with the /monitor switch, it 
  allows you to show or hide a particular bucket in your list. It only 
  affects your personal list, not the global hidden status of the bucket.
  
  +bucket/create <bucket>=<description>
  This command creates <bucket> with the <description> you provide. You must
  set a lock for the bucket on the Job Database <JD>, as it defaults to 1 
  (anyone who can pass the main lock can access it). /create is Wizard-only.
 
  Example lock:
     &ACCESS_VAMP Job Database <JD>=[switch(get(%0/RACE),VAMPIRE,1,0)]
  
  Please see: buckets2
  
& buckets2
  +bucket/hide <bucket>
  +bucket/show <bucket>
  +bucket/post <bucket>=<board#>
  
  Using the /hide switch will hide <bucket> from standard job lists, and
  turns it into a hidden bucket. /show is the opposite of this, placing 
  <bucket> back into shown bucket status.
 
  Using the /post switch, you can force which <board #> that <bucket> posts
  to when a +job/complete is performed on it. Note that this performs no 
  error checking. You need to make sure that the Job Tracker object can 
  access the <board#> and is able to post with it. Setting <board #> to '0',
  it will return the <bucket> to post to the default BBS.

  Please see: buckets3

& buckets3
  
  +bucket/access <player>=<bucket>
  
  This command toggles access to <bucket> to the named <player>. This allows
  them to bypass the default bucket locks. They must still pass the main 
  lock to access. You can change who can alter access with the GIVE_ACCESS 
  on the Job Database <JD> object. It defaults to wizard only.
  
  +bucket/delete <bucket>
  
  This permanently removes <bucket>. The bucket must have no jobs inside of
  it for it to be successful. Wizard only.
